Visual Studio Tools for Applications (VSTA) is a set of tools that independent
software vendors (ISVs) can use to build customization abilities into their
applications for both automation and extensibility. Those customization
abilities can be used by end-users to tailor the ISV's application within a
managed extensibility environment just like Visual Basic for Applications.
